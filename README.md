# Wordle Game-Java
This is a simple implementation of the Wordle game in Java. Players have six attempts to guess a randomly selected word from a predefined list. The game provides feedback by highlighting correct letters in green and yellow.

## Features

- Randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
- Allows users to make guesses.
- Displays feedback on guessed letters:
  - Green for correct letters in the correct position.
  - Yellow for correct letters in the wrong position.
  - Regular text for incorrect letters.
- Keeps track of remaining attempts.
- Clears the console for a better user experience.


## Summary
- Using abstraction and encapsulation in my Wordle game allows me to create a clean and maintainable codebase. 
- Abstraction simplifies interaction with the game logic, while encapsulation protects the internal state of the game and enforces the rules through controlled access. 
- This not only enhances code readability but also makes it easier to modify and extend in the future.
